# Programming-Languages

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving
Project 3 is a C++ program that reads through a grocery list of items in a seaprate .txt document, tracks how frequently each item appears in the list, and displays this information to the user in a variety of ways. The Program also backups this frequency data, saving it to a separate data file.

# What did you do particularly well?
I believe my functions for handling the read-through of the initial text docuemnt and displaying this information to the user are all solid, all successfully implementing what is required. I also like how I handled the main menu UI, believing it is easy to navigate.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could've used more functions and classes, since I probably put more code then was needed in the main. This would've made the codec cleaner as well as easier to edit later with minimal errors.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found the histogram the most challenging piece of code to write due to just how many factors there were, as well as my tendency to prefer While loops over For loops. The resources I used to overcome this was firstly Zybooks to refresh my memory on For Loop syntax in C++, and then the staple help website Stack Overflow for different examples on how people made hsitograms in C++

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Reading and writing in Data Files is a common part of coding no matter the language, so finally having experience with it will prove useful in my future coding classes.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I included many in-line comments to make the text readable for anyone needing to look at it. I also heavily used functions throughout, making the code more easily maintainable and adaptable for future needs.
